Desktop application for detection size and shape of gold nanoparticles and nanorods from TEM image (Bachelor's project) <br>
It is still in process, so results may look badly, functions may look strange etc. <br>
Example of how algorithm works can be seen in <a href=https://github.com/pulcovamon/Nanoparticles_app/wiki>Wiki</a>. <br>
